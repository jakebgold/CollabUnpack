## CollabUnpack

Install this file wherever is convenient. Before running, change 'rootdir'
to the directory where all your students' answers are saved, and
'assignment' to the name of the assignment.

After running, every students' assignment should appear in the folder titled 'all'. Any students whose files threw an error will be mentioned in the console after the program runs. You should manually open their folders to get their work.
